### Pulltodo - A pull request to-do list for MacOS

Pulltodo allows you to manage all your pull requests in a single place. 
Not only that, instead of just showing all pull requests, it will drill down into each pull request, analyze what you need to do, and generate to-do lists for you.
Awesome, right?!!!

Supports Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket.
Available now on the [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pulltodo/id1614217899)
